Globehunter (Please use for demos only. API calls aren't free!)

Random locations are generated using 3geonames.org, first generating a random location on land
and then taking the nearest country and generating a random location in that country.

Another function is the used to find the nearest Google Streetview within a 5000KM radius (function partly provided by google maps api)

A fix for repeated locations and black panoramas has not yet been implemented.
